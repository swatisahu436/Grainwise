              <p>
                Major events like those at Wimbledon generate significant food
                demand, and with it, a responsibility to minimize environmental
                impact. Gourmet Gurus aimed to introduce innovative, nutritious,
                and sustainable options that would resonate with health-conscious
                attendees.
