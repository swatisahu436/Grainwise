              We are proud to work with Goacher‚Äôs Brewery, Kent‚Äôs oldest microbrewery, a family-owned institution with
              over 40 years of crafting award-winning ales.
            </p>
            <p>
              Goacher‚Äôs commitment to quality is evident in their careful selection of the finest, locally sourced
              ingredients and their adherence to traditional brewing methods. This dedication ensures their beers are
              exceptional, and it also means their spent grains are of the highest caliber.
            </p>
            <p>
              We responsibly source these spent grains from Goacher‚Äôs, recognizing that the craftsmanship of our
              suppliers is directly reflected in the aroma, quality, and nutritional value of this valuable byproduct.
              These grains, once part of a brewing masterpiece, now become the foundation for our innovative GrainWise
              Tortillas.
